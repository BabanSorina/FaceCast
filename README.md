# FaceCast

This is a React-Native application that helps a user find his desired podcast based on some personal preferences and a emotion displayed on this face. 

It uses the iTunes API to search for content within the iTunes Store and displays it.
All data is stored in cloud Firestore and the authentication is done using Firebase Authentication. 
The emotion recognition is done using the Azure Face API.


## KEY FEATURES:
* Easy to understand UI/UX= The UserInterface and UserExperience were created with the intent to ease the time spend browsing the application

* Emotion detection= Emotion recognition is one of the Artificial Intelligence  technologies that when implemented in an application changes the way we use our phone.

* Unique podcast recommendation= The user has the chance to try a different approach to searching  for the perfect podcast to listen to(a task that most people struggle with)
